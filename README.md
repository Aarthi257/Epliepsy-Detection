Employing Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Epileptic Seizures

This repository contains the code and resources for the project titled "Employing Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Epileptic Seizures Through Physiological Signals." This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to improve the detection of epileptic seizures using EEG signals, providing an efficient and accurate solution for real-time healthcare applications.

## Abstract

Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurring seizures. This project explores the integration of advanced machine learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BiGRU, with a ResNet-based framework and Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module to detect epileptic seizures accurately using EEG signals. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy and reliability compared to traditional approaches.

## Libraries:

- TensorFlow

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- scikit-learn

##  Usage

 - Preprocess the EEG dataset by running the preprocessing script.

- Train the model of your choice (LSTM, GRU, etc.) by executing the respective training script.

- Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results using the performance analysis notebook.

- Optionally, modify the architecture or hyperparameters in the scripts for further experimentation.
